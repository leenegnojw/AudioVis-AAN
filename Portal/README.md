# Sound_and_Vision | Portal

Another experiment visualizing sound, this time something which resembles an artistic representation of a portal/black hole. 

## Dependencies
Sketch was made with Processing 3.2.1. and relies on the external Minim library (version 2.2.2). 
* [Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/minim/) - Library used to process the audio 

## Getting started

To not be bothered with all the noise arround your system, use the audio directly.
On Ubuntu this can be done for example through pavucontrol.

```
~$ sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
~$ pavucontrol
```
run the sketch, go to the recording tab and set the it to Monitor of Built-in Audio Analog Stereo.
Of course, you don't have to.
